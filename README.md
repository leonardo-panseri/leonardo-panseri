### University Projects
#### Master
- [PrivTAP](https://github.com/PrivTap/PrivTap) [CURRENTLY PRIVATE] - Privacy focused trigger-action platform developed in the context of the [SCORE competition](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-score-2023), hosted by the [International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2023).
- [CICERO on Arduino](https://github.com/leonardo-panseri/cicero-on-vidor4000) [CURRENTLY PRIVATE] - Implementation of CICERO, a Domain-Specific Architecture to perform regular expression matching on FPGAs, on the Arduino MKR Vidor 4000. The goal of this project is to build a proof of concept for complex task offloading to FPGAs in the IoT world. We have built a low cost and energy efficient system that can perform intrusion detection with good tradeoffs compared to traditional systems.
- [CICERO on Intel](https://github.com/leonardo-panseri/cicero-port-to-intel) - Porting of CICERO, a Domain-Specific Architecture to perform regular expression matching on FPGAs, to the Intel Cyclone 10 FPGA.
- [RoboMarkt veichle routing problem](https://github.com/leonardo-panseri/for-project-2022) - Linear optimization model aided by heuristics to solve the veichle routing problem for a fictional company called RoboMarkt.
- [Nuxt.js website](https://github.com/amangabba/HYPE-GabbaPanseriNumeroliSanti) - Website for a tourism destination town.

#### Bachelor
- [TextEdit](https://github.com/leonardo-panseri/api-project-19-20) - Command line text editor with undo and redo capabilities.
- [Histogram Equalizer](https://github.com/leonardo-panseri/rl-project-20-21) - VHDL description of an IP for a Virtex 7 FPGA that executes a simplified algorithm for image histogram equalization.
- [Master of Renaissance](https://github.com/leonardo-panseri/ing-sw-2021-panseri-spada-mornatta) - JavaFX implementation of board game [Master of Renaissance](https://craniointernational.com/products/masters-of-renaissance/), with multiplayer up to 4 players.
- [Ebazon](https://github.com/davidemornatta/tiw-2021-mornatta-panseri-zancani) - E-commerce website made with Java servlets and a JavaScript frontend based on AJAX.
